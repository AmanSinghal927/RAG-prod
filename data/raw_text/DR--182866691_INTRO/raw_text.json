The program was designed to identify specific individuals within public and private organizations who might be interested in joining ITE or attending ITE functions. The captains also assist with advertising meetings, recruiting new members, and promoting ITE. \nThe Oregon Section maintained and enhanced the solid financial position that had been developed over the past several years. The Oregon Section has signed up for online banking and uses a check card for most routine expenditures. Payments and account inquiries are processed faster and the overall number of reimbursement checks are reduced significantly.  \nMost monthly functions for the 2007-08 fiscal year have either broken even or in the case of the January Technical Workshop have had a net income due to better than average attendance. This can be attributed to interesting topics, user-friendly and informative web site as well as the hard work of Section officers and volunteers. The remainder of this page summarizes the Section s 2007-2008 finances. \nDoes your section have a Federal Employer Identification Number  \nBalance of Funds on hand at the Beginning of the Reporting Period: \nAs of April 1, 2007: $20,308.82 \nINCOME FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD (April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008): \nMembership Dues:  $4,405.00 \nGross Income from Meetings:  $6,455.00 \nInvestment Income:  $ 0.00 \nAdvertising Income:  $0.00 (None reported) \nOther Sources of Income:  $5,238.54(Corporate sponsorship at Traffic Bowl) \nGolf Tournament:  $5,455.00 (Corporate sponsorship $1,750.00 + $3,705.00 members) \nDistrict 6 Student Fund:  $3,000.00 \nTotal Income:   $ 24,553.54 \nEXPENDITURE FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD (April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008): \nOregon ITE Meetings and Workshops:  $8,929.53 \nDistrict 6 Meeting $1,311.66 \nDonations:  $1,450 (Including Traffic Bowl prizes to student chapters) \nInternet Expenses: $234.00 \nOther Expenditures: $382.25 (Board Meetings) \nGolf Tournament:  $5,754.82 \nMiscellaneous:  $284.89 (PO box, election costs, etc.) \nTotal Expenditures:   $18,347.15 \nBalance of Funds on hand at the End of the Reporting Period (March 31, 2008): \n$26,515.21 ($26,394.71 in Bank Account + $120.50 in Petty Cash) \nWas there a change in the Section Bylaws during this reporting period  \n4. LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES \nApproximately 13 transportation related bills were passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly during the 2007 session. The topics of the bills vary widely, including issues such as expanding the use of photo radar and red light enforcement, various signing requirements, and gates for light rail pedestrian crossings. Details on the bills are provided to the Oregon Section membership at http://www.oregonite.org/legs/legs2.php. \nThe Oregon Section conducted six (6) general meetings and the summer golf tournament over the past year, as well as hosting Joint 2007 ITE District 6 annual meeting. The general meetings included luncheons with speakers, joint-meetings with other professional societies, the annual traffic bowl, and a technical workshop. The table below summarizes the general meetings conducted over the past year and those scheduled for the remainder of 2008. \nOREGON SECTION MEETINGS \n<table><tr><td>Date </td>\t<td>Meeting </td>\t<td>Subject </td>\t<td>Location </td>\t<td>Attendees </td>\t</tr> <tr><td>4-10-07 </td>\t<td>April - Joint meeting with </td>\t<td>WTS </td>\t<td>Kris Strickler and Danielle Cogan gave a presentation on the Columbia River Crossing project on the I-5 bridge that connects Oregon and Washington. </td>\t<td>Embassy Suites Hotel Portland, OR </td>\t<td>60 </td>\t</tr> <tr><td>5-18-07 </td>\t<td>May - Joint meeting with Oregon Traffic Control Devices Committee </td>\t<td>(OTCDC) </td>\t<td>Sections newly elected officers were announced and a presentation on the Highway 25 emergency reconstruction efforts that followed a large storm on Mt.

TECHNICAL ACTIVITIES: \nTechnical Committee: \nThe Section sponsored the annual January Technical Workshop on Tort, Liability, Ethics, and Professionalism in Transportation with featured speakers John Mason (Penn State University), Rayann Speakman (FHWA), Karen Dixon (Oregon State University), Mike Coleman (City of Portland), Brian Ray, Beth Wemple (Kittelson and Associates), and Ken Crowley (Oregon DOJ). This workshop was well attended as with years past.  \n7.  STUDENT CHAPTER ACTIVITIES \nThe Student Liaison Committee had another successful year in attracting schools from the Pacific Northwest to compete in the Oregon Section's annual Traffic Bowl Competition. The Traffic Bowl is a Jeopardy-based trivia contest where students must answer questions on a variety of traffic and transportation trivia. This year the competition was held on November 15, 2007 at McMenamin's Edgefield just east of Portland, Oregon. \nThis year we had 52 students from six universities attending the event. Participating schools were: \nPortland State University \nUniversity of Portland \nOregon State University \nUniversity of Washington \nOregon Institute of Technology \nUniversity of Portland took home the grand prize of bragging rights, a trophy and a $400 scholarship award. University of Washington and Oregon Institute of Technology both received $300 for tying for second place. The remaining three participating schools received a $150 participation award. All of the student attendees received a free dinner at this event. In order to offset the cost of the student meals and scholarships, several local companies donated funds to support student attendance. Donations were received from: Advanced Traffic Products, CH2M Hill, City of Gresham, City of Portland, Coral Sales Company, David Evans and Associates, DKS Associates, Group Mackenzie, HDR, IBI Group, JRH Engineering, Kittelson and Associates, Lancaster Engineering, NWS Traffic Engineering, Parametrix, Quality Counts, TrafStats, URS Corp, W&H Pacific, and Western Systems.  The Oregon Section has already secured the room for Traffic Bowl 2008 (November, 2008) at McMenamin s Edgefield. \nThis year, students continued to enjoy substantial discounts at Oregon ITE Section meetings ranging from free (Traffic Bowl) to $5 (Section Meetings) depending on the actual cost of the event and level of corporate sponsorship. \n8.  OTHER ACTIVITIES \nThis year the Oregon Section retained the domain name, www.oregonite.org. The website remained very dynamic and was modified significantly to reflect the changing needs of the Section. The web page includes information about meetings, activities, officer contact information, upcoming conferences, available jobs, and section news. The site always has the current and upcoming meeting information posted, and on-line registration for Section meetings continued to be both popular and successful. In addition, electronic download of the registration information were used to produce the registration list, name badges and written receipts for any specific event. This form of registration has proven to be very effective and user friendly for members. \nAnnual Golf Tournament: \nThe Oregon Section hosted its 18th annual ITE Golf Tournament at Quail Valley Golf Course on September 21, 2007. The tournament drew 57 competitors from across the state. The golf event was held at Oregon Golf Association (OGA) in Woodburn, Oregon. This location is approximately 30 miles south of Portland. Turnout was good, exceeding last year s attendance, and it was a fun and entertaining event. In addition to volunteers, Lancaster Engineering, David Evans & Associates, DKS Associates, Quality Counts, Parsons Brinkerhoff, Inc., Kittelson & Associates, Inc., All Traffic Data Services, TrafStats, Western Systems and NW Signal sponsored the event. \nSpeaker Appreciation Gifts: \nIt is the Oregon Section s tradition to recognize the speaker at the Monthly Section Meetings and various other guests of the Section by presenting them with a token gift. USB thumb drives printed with an Oregon ITE logo were purchased as speaker gifts this year, as were handmade coffee mugs with the Oregon ITE logo. \nDistrict 6 Meeting - Local Arrangements Committee: \nThe Oregon Section helped arrange the 2007 District 6 (now Western District) meeting that was held July 15 to 18 in Portland.  This meeting was combined with the Quad Conference to expand the reach of this event to our friends in Vancouver, BC. The Quad meeting was originally scheduled to take place in 2008 in Portland, but the Oregon Section swapped meeting years with the Vancouver Island Section in order to better coordinate the district and quad meetings (a win-win situation for both Sections). \nThe District 6 meeting was a huge success in that it attracted over 500 attendees. The committee, chaired by Peter Koonce, was responsible for setting up a great technical and social event for the members of District 6. Some of the highlights include: \n  PTOE/PTP/TSOS/TOPS Exam Offering \n  James H. Kell Student Competition \n  36 Technical Sessions \n  Awards Banquet (Bikes, Brews and Bohemia) \n  Multi-Modal Brewery Tour \n  Family Night at the Oregon Zoo \nThe Oregon Section recognized several groups and individuals during 2007-08. The Section provided over $1,450 in awards to various ITE Student Sections throughout the greater Northwest. The awards granted over the past year are summarized below. \nTraffic Bowl - First Place Award \n University of Portland \nTo Encourage Student Participation in Oregon Section ITE \n $400 to Student Chapter \n"
