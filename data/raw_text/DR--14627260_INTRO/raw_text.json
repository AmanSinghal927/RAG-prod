The firm specialises in personal injuries, medical negligence, employment and industrial law, dust diseases, superannuation (particularly total and permanent disability claims), negligent financial and other advice, and consumer and commercial class actions. \nMaurice Blackburn employs over 1000 staff, including approximately 330 lawyers who provide advice and assistance to thousands of clients each year. The advice services are often provided free of charge as it is firm policy in many areas to give the first consultation for free. The firm also has a substantial social justice practice. \nMaurice Blackburn is grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this important inquiry, and congratulates the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) on its instigation. \nOur experience and expertise in representing those who have fallen victim to the scourge of sexual harassment in the workplace affords us a unique view of the current system for handling complaints. This includes observations on the various pieces of legislation which make up the current framework, the complaints and appeals processes, and the assistance available to victims. \nThe impacts on victims can be life long and life changing. \nMaurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the first instance. We believe there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees. \nWe believe that it is important that the governing bodies of all organisations should be fully aware of the incidence of sexual harassment in their workplace, and that they should be required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their reporting requirements to Workplace Gender Equality Agency ( WGEA ). \nWe believe that the current legislated timeframe for making a complaint through AHRC is unworkable and out of step with other legislative provisions. It should be amended to 6 years in line with other employment law jurisdictions. We believe that the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (the AHRC Act) or regulations should be amended to expressly prescribe time frames for the scheduling of mediation conferences. \nWe believe that other authorities, such as State and Territory Work, Health and Safety regulators, along with trade unions and consumer advocates, could and should have a greater role to play in addressing and stamping out workplace sexual harassment. \nAbove all, we believe that the AHRC should be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its statutory objectives and enable it to more swiftly and robustly perform its vital role in resolving claims of sexual harassment in the workplace. \nIn preparing this submission, Maurice Blackburn has engaged with a number of organisations such as NOW Australia and Unions NSW, who share our goal of preventing sexual harassment from occurring in Australian workplaces and securing justice for victims. Specifically, Maurice Blackburn, NOW Australia and Unions NSW hosted a roundtable with \nunion officials, politicians, barristers and labour lawyers, to facilitate a discussion about the most effective legislative reforms to secure justice for victims of sexual harassment. These round table discussions allowed Maurice Blackburn to draw from the knowledge of other highly experienced professionals working in employment law and industrial relations, in formulating this submission. \nThese key themes are explored in more detail in the following pages. We also refer the AHRC to the joint statement submitted by over 100 organisations including Maurice Blackburn and the submission to this inquiry from Women Lawyers NSW, which addresses some of these matters in more detail (and with which representatives of Maurice Blackburn have been involved). \nMaurice Blackburn Responses to Terms of Reference. \n1. Online workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment and the use of technology and social media to perpetrate workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment \nMaurice Blackburn is concerned about the impacts that online workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment is having on many Australians under the current, mostly unregulated on-line environment. \nWe draw the AHRC s attention to the effects of exposure to such behaviours by those whose work, by necessity, involves interaction via social media platforms. \nIn particular, we are concerned by the reports from journalists and those involved in the media about the prevalence and impacts of on-line workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment. \nWe believe that employers must be held accountable for creating a work environment that exposes their employees to the risk of this form of sexual harassment. \nWe are aware that some employers in the media industry, for example, have expectations of their staff relating to their on-line inputs, and set key performance indicators in areas such as the number of  hits  a story receives. \nJournalists are also frequently expected by their employers to participate in on-line discussions that emanate from their story. Some employees have reported that employers expect them to express personal opinions in relation to on-line stories. We are concerned that these  forced  interactions are exposing media professionals to online workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment. \nWe note the reporting of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) on this matter: \n The lived experience of many MEAA members working in the media industry is of being regularly subjected to harassment, abuse and threats on social media . 1 \nMEAA has written substantially on the topic, noting that their members have suffered diagnosable psychiatric injuries as a consequence of cyber abuse. \n1 Ref Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance submission to Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee inquiry into the adequacy of existing offences in the Commonwealth Criminal Code and of state and territory criminal laws to capture cyberbullying: https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx id=5590919d-ca1e-4049-9834-44ab87e8bedc&subId=562289 \nThere appears to be clear differences in the impacts of interaction with the readership, between on-line and traditional media functions. These include: \nAnonymity. Reports suggest that anonymity may be a determining factor in whether on-line input is threatening, abusive or personal. It seems probable that the ability to hide behind anonymity might be an enabler of on-line sexual harassment. Journalists, on the other hand, are encouraged to use their own names. This inequality is concerning in the workplace context. \nImmediacy. Responding to on-line media does not encourage introspection or the tempering of language or behaviour. \nThe perception that  the rules are different on-line . Threats or harassment made on-line seem to be held to a different standard of accountability than if they were made via any other mechanism. Some of the current academic work around  online disinhibition  is worthy of exploration. \nWe have long argued that a legislative framework is needed which incorporates: \nRegulation and criminal sanctions holding the behaviours of abusers, employers and carriage services to account, and \nA civil regime through which victims and survivors of online abuse can access legal tools to allow them to seek relief and damages. \nThis will necessitate criminalising particularly nefarious behaviours, and then providing the relevant police and regulatory services with the resources to successfully prosecute people engaging in sexual harassment through on-line platforms. \nWe believe that, for this to have the required deterrent effect, it is important that all those who cause, enable or expose people to on-line sexual harassment should be held to account, and this includes employers, and social media platforms, as well as those who generate and distribute the abusive material. \nWe recognise, however, that given the scope and pervasiveness of on-line sexual harassment, no regulator or law enforcement agency, no matter how well equipped, will be in a position to effectively deal with every case, let alone every extreme case. Hence the need for a concurrent civil process which provides citizens with the tools required to achieve appropriate redress. \nMaurice Blackburn believes Australia needs a civil / criminal legislative framework which could ensure: \nThat breaches, can be investigated by a statutory body established under the Act, and failing that, the courts. \nThat the statutory body can order that offending materials be removed from an on-line platform, and require a correction and/or an apology. \nThat the frameworks allows for the release of the identity of anonymous abusers. \nThat on-line sexual harassment is criminalised where: \nthe abuser intends a digital communication to cause harm, \na person would reasonably expect the person in the position of the victim to be harmed, and \nthe individual suffers serious emotional distress. \nOur submissions in response to ToR 1: \nMaurice Blackburn submits that changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment must include enforceable sanctions against employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees. \nMaurice Blackburn encourages the AHRC to consider ways that employers can assist in creating a workplace where exposure to discussion and engagement via social media platforms does not impact an employee s right to a safe work environment. \nWe encourage the AHRC to reimagine how a criminal code and a civil regime to combat on-line sexual harassment in Australia might be implemented. \nWe submit that any discussion on criminality and penalties must also recognise that it is important to give individuals the legal tools to allow them to: \nSeek injunctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on-line sexual harassment, and \nSeek injunctive relief and damages from the providers and facilitators of online forums where the provider or facilitator has failed to discharge a duty to monitor and protect users. \n2. The use of technology and social media to identify both alleged victims and perpetrators of workplace-related sexual harassment \nNo response to this Term of Reference \n3. The drivers of workplace sexual harassment, including whether: some individuals are more likely to experience sexual harassment due to particular characteristics including gender, age, sexual orientation, culturally or linguistically diverse background, Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander status or disability, and some workplace characteristics and practices are more likely to increase the risk of sexual harassment. \nMaurice Blackburn s staff regularly assist clients who have experienced sexual harassment or sex-based discrimination. \nEvery day, we witness the serious and damaging effect it can have on a person and a workplace. \nABS data2 suggests that one in two women (53% or 5 million) and one in four men (25% or 2.2 million) have experienced sexual harassment during their lifetime. In the last 12 months, one in six women (17% or 1.6 million) and one in eleven men (9.3% or 836,700) experienced \nsexual harassment, and the proportion of women experiencing sexual harassment in the last 12 months has increased from 15% in 2012 to 17% in 2016. \n2https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/chapter-4-nature-sexual-harassment-australian-workplaces-sexual-harassment-serious \nWe are mindful of the figures which the AHRC recently published3 which show that: \nIn the last 12 months, 23% of women and 16% of men have experienced sexual harassment at work; \nWomen of colour, young adults (18-24), those with a disability, and LGBTI people are particular targets of sexual harassment4; \nIn the last 5 years, 81% of employees in the information, media and telecommunications industry having been sexually harassed; \n40% of workplace sexual harassment incidents were witnessed by at least one other person, and in the majority of cases (69%) the witness did not intervene; \nFewer than one in five people made a formal report or complaint about sexual harassment in the workplace; and \nAlmost one in five people who did report sexual harassment were either labelled a trouble-maker; ostracised, victimised or ignored by colleagues; or resigned. \nThese statistics, broadly speaking, reflect the lived experience of our clients. \nIn our and their experience, sexual harassment is largely about power and so it will be more frequently visited on the most vulnerable including those in precarious employment and those who cannot take the great risk of speaking out about abuse. The trauma caused by sexual harassment cannot and must not be underestimated. \n4. The current legal framework with respect to sexual harassment. \nThere are a number of areas within the current legal framework where Maurice Blackburn believes that adjustment is required in order to achieve the goals of this inquiry. \nIn the section below, we have separated these into a number of discrete areas of law for discussion: \nPositive obligation on employers; \nExpanding company reporting requirements; \n6 month time limit on complaints; \nThe Complaints Process. \n3 Australian Human Rights Commission,  Everyone s Business: Fourth National Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces  (2018). \n4 Australian Human Rights Commission, Change the Course: National Report on Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment at Australian Universities (2017). \ni. Positive obligation on employers \nSexual harassment in the workplace has been prohibited in Australia since the passing of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) ( SDA ). However, the persistent prevalence of sexual harassment within Australian workplaces since that time suggests that the current legislation has failed in preventing this kind of conduct. \nMaurice Blackburn is of the view that one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the first instance. \nThe current legislative scheme requires victims of sexual harassment to take the step of making a complaint before they are able to pursue a remedy in relation to the unlawful harassment ( the Individual Complaint Model )5 . \nThis means that an individual, who may (and often does) have limited access to the law, is obliged to take the step of filing a complaint with the AHRC, in order to seek redress. This process can be burdensome and difficult to navigate without legal advice. We will return to our concerns regarding the current system in our discussion on the Complaints Process. \nIt can also be daunting for victims who are emotionally distressed, unfamiliar with legal processes, fearful of reprisal, and who are unsure of their legal rights. Further, women who are of a low economic status, who are from migrant backgrounds, or who have limited career mobility are among the most vulnerable groups6. \nIndeed, it is the persistent and increasingly low rates of reporting7 that fundamentally undermines the effectiveness of the Individual Complaint Model8 . In the Fourth National Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces ( the Fourth Report ), the AHRC found that only 17 percent of people who had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace reported the behaviour9 . \nThat means that in 83 percent of cases, the victims did not make a complaint for a whole host of reasons. These statistics demonstrate that in the vast majority of cases the current legislative scheme has both failed to prevent the conduct through deterrence, and has failed to address the conduct through providing victims with access to an adequate remedy. \nUnder the current scheme, an employer s obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment only becomes relevant where they are defending a claim of sexual harassment - that is, after the harassment and the harm have already occurred10 . \nSpecifically, under s106 of the SDA an employer can escape vicarious liability for sexual harassment, where it can establish that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the sexual harassment from occurring11 . \n5 Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Parliament of Australia, Half Way to Equal: Report of the Inquiry into Equal Opportunity and Equal Status for Women in Australia (1992) ( Halfway to Equal Report ). \n6Elyse Shaw, Ariane Hegewisch, M. Phil and Cynthia Hess, (2018)  Sexual Harassment and Assault at Work: Understanding the Costs  Institute for Women s Policy Research. \n7 Everyone s business: Fourth National Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces, p63. \n8 Paula McDonald, Sara Charlesworth, Tina Graham (2015) Asia Pacific Journal of Human Resources  Developing a framework of effective prevention and response strategies in workplace sexual harassment , Vol 53, Issue 1. \n9 Everyone s business: Fourth National Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces, p63. \n10 S106 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth). \n11 S106 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth). \nWhile there is no definition of  reasonable steps  contained in the SDA,  reasonable steps  may include having an internal policy that prohibits sexual harassment, conducting training on what constitutes sexual harassment and dealing with sexual harassment complaints in an appropriate manner. \nMaurice Blackburn is of the view that the burden currently borne by victims to enforce their rights should be more evenly shared between victims, employees, and employers. \nMaurice Blackburn submits that rather than the obligation to take reasonable steps being used to prevent sexual harassment being used as a defence to liability, the SDA should impose a positive obligation on employers to take all reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment occurring in the workplace, whether an incident has occurred or not. \nThis positive obligation would work in a similar way to, and in conjunction with, the statutory obligation an employer has to ensure the health and safety of its employees when they are at work in accordance with relevant workplace health and safety legislation. \nWe note that this was recommended by the HREOC in their submission to the Senate Inquiry on the Effectiveness of the Sex Discrimination Act, in 200812 but was not adopted. We are of the view that it should have been. \nii. Health and Safety \nThe duty proposed in the previous section should not detract from the current and often ignored responsibility of safety regulators in each State and Territory to investigate and prosecute breaches of health and safety legislation. \nIn our view, it should be made abundantly clear, via legislative reform or through delegated legislation, that regulators are required to investigate sexual harassment complaints given the health and safety implications of same. \nWe acknowledge that regulators are chronically understaffed and underfunded in many States and Territories and would encourage the establishment of a properly funded discrete directorate within WHS regulators aimed at investigating risks to health and safety arising from sexual harassment. \nIn order to reduce the load on regulators, trade unions should also have the ability to prosecute for health and safety breaches reinstated where such rights have been removed. \niii. Expanding company reporting requirements \nIt has been argued by the leading academics in this space that the prevention of sexual harassment is enhanced if senior managers in a workplace understand what behaviour constitutes sexual harassment and that there are consequences for the business if it occurs13 . \nMaurice Blackburn considers the elimination of sexual harassment against women in the workplace to be an essential component of achieving gender equality more broadly. \n12 Submission of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, Inquiry Into The Effectiveness Of The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) In Eliminating Discrimination And Promoting Gender Equality, 2008, pg145. \n13 McDonald, Charlesworth, Graham (2015). \nBusinesses are already required by legislation to report on key gender equality indicators to WGEA annually. We are of the view that as part of this reporting, businesses should also be required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment. \nFurther, reporting to Board and senior management level (in smaller business) must also be mandated if real cultural change is to occur. \nWhilst we acknowledge that the figure reported will not be representative of the true number of instances of sexual harassment given the very low reporting rates, we are of the view that this measure would create an important incentive for large businesses, and their senior managers, to take their obligation to prevent sexual harassment seriously. \niv. 6 month time limit on complaints \nFollowing a Joint Parliamentary Committee inquiry into freedom of speech ( JPC Inquiry ) in April 2017 the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (2017) ( the Amendment ) was passed by both houses of Parliament. \nOne of the most significant effects of the Amendment was to amend s46PH of the AHRC Act so that a complaint, including a complaint in relation to sexual harassment, can be terminated by the President of the AHRC if it is lodged more than 6 months after the alleged events took place. \nThe effect of this change is significant. While this time limit does not operate in the same way as a statutory limitation period does, the effect of a decision of the President to terminate the complaint is that a complainant loses access to the confidential mediation process facilitated by the AHRC. \nThe benefit of having access to the AHRC s mediation process is that it allows victims of sexual harassment, whom typically have restricted access to the law, the opportunity to engage in a relatively low cost, less adversarial dispute resolution process. \nMaurice Blackburn submits the Amendment should be repealed and that the time for making complaints should be amended to 6 years in line with other employment law jurisdictions. \nThis submission is made for the following reasons: \nThere is no sound policy reason for imposing the time period on complaints; \nA six-month time period is out of step with other Australian employment law jurisdictions; and \nReducing access to an informal, low-cost dispute resolution process has a negative impact on the efficient resolution of complaints. \nThese are elaborated upon below: \nThere is no sound policy reason for the new time limit. \nAt the time the Amendment was passed, there was no clear policy rationale put forward by the legislature for the change to the time limit, save for the apparent need to mitigate unmeritorious or vexatious claims being made14 . \nThe JPC Inquiry recommended that the AHRC adopt time limits for the processes related to complaint handling activities at the initial assessment of the complaint15 . However, this recommendation did not extend to reducing the time limit a complainant has to lodge a complaint16 . \nIndeed, the JPC Inquiry made a number of recommendations in relation to expanding the President s power to terminate a complaint pursuant to s46PH of the Act. Notably, none of these recommendations related to reducing the time limit available to complainants for lodging a complaint. \nThere is no evidence which suggests claims that are made more than six months after the alleged events took place are less meritorious than those that are made before this time period. \nIn fact, to the contrary, it is well documented that victims of sexual harassment may face a number of hurdles in bringing a complaints in short time periods for a number of reasons, including the emotional and psychological impact the conduct often has them.17 \nOf the 17 percent of people who made a complaint to their supervisor, the majority of complaints were made shortly after the events occurred. The statistics in relation to the timing of reporting sexual harassment were set out comprehensively by the AHRC in the Fourth Report, and are illustrated in the graph below. \n14 Explanatory Memorandum, Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, para 116-118. \n15 Recommendation 8 of Report Freedom of speech in Australia Inquiry into the operation of Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) and related procedures under the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth) \n16Recommendation 8 of Report Freedom of speech in Australia Inquiry into the operation of Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) and related procedures under the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth). \n17 See for example https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/us/kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford.html \nMaurice Blackburn is of the view that these statistics demonstrate two things: \nGiven that underreporting remains high, it may be the case that the majority of victims require more than 6 months to make a complaint; and \nIt is simply not the case that a large number of victims report sexual harassment a long time after it has occurred, so as to justify the imposition of the 6 month time restriction as a deterrence for a large number of unmeritorious complaints. \nThis means that in addition to there being no sound policy reason for the time period for lodging sexual harassment complaints with the AHRC being reduced to 6 months, there is a strong case for the time period being extended beyond the 12 month period that is placed on complaints in different jurisdictions, and which existed before the Amendment was enacted. \nFor this reason, the time limit imposed by s46PH(b) of the AHRC Act should be abolished, especially with respect to sexual harassment complaints. \nWe are of the view that the 6 year time limitation period that applies to other kinds of discrimination matters in the Fair Work jurisdiction should apply to complaints made by the AHRC, particularly for sexual harassment complaints. \nAdditionally, there are sufficient grounds under s46PH of the AHRC Act that allow the President to terminate a complaint where the complaint is without merit or is better dealt with in another jurisdiction, without the inclusion of s46PH(b). \nIndeed, s46PH(c) provides the President with very broad powers to terminate a complaint in circumstances where  having regard to all the circumstances, that an inquiry, or the continuation of an inquiry, into the (<http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ahrca1986373/s3.html#complaint>)complaint is not warranted . \nWe submit that if there is a legitimate concern that a complaint was without merit for any reason, the President is still able to exercise his/her power to terminate it under this provision. \nComparable Jurisdictions \nThe 6 month time limit is particularly short when compared with similar jurisdictions that deal with discrimination or employment law issues. \nBy way of comparison, the discrimination provisions of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) allow discrimination claims to be dealt with by the Fair Work Commission provided that they are brought within 6 years of the alleged events occurring, where the complaint does not involve dismissal. \nFurther, the Anti-Discrimination Act 1975 (NSW), only allows the President of the Anti-Discrimination Board to terminate a complaint if it is brought more than 12 months after the alleged events occurred. \nMaurice Blackburn is of the view, that 12 months is a particularly short time period, but 6 months is simply unjustified. \nThe damages awarded in sexual harassment matters have historically been significantly lower than comparable jurisdictions in which an applicant suffers an illness as a result of unlawful conduct. \nWhile this trend was disturbed somewhat after the decision in Richardson v Oracle Corporation Australia Pty Ltd18 ( Oracle ), where the complainant was awarded $130,000.00 the detrimental impact of historically low awards of damages should not be underestimated. \nIndeed, at the time of writing, there is an absence of a significant body of case law which supports the approach taken by the Federal Court of Appeal, in Oracle. While subsequent cases have referenced Oracle s emphasis on changing community standards to support the rationale behind increasing awards of damages, this rationale has not been reflected in the quantum awarded to complainants. \nFurther, our experience in assisting clients navigate the legal process with respect to sexual harassment complaints suggests that the low awards of damages has an additional deterrent effect when a complainant is making a decision to file a complaint with the AHRC or commence litigation. \nWhile damages are assessed in a similar way to tortious common law claims, given claimant s  rights emerge from statute, there may be scope for providing more specific statutory guidance as to the appropriate quantum in respect of awards of damages. \nFor example, it has been argued that an increased focus on exemplary damages, rather than compensatory damages would better reflect the moral wrong caused by the conduct and have a greater deterrent effect on perpetrators 19 . \nOne possible reform to remedy this issue would be the insertion of statutory criteria to be taken into account by the Courts when determining an award of damages. \nIn NSW there is a statutory cap of $100,000.00 pursuant to s108(7) of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 (NSW) ( the ADA ). In Western Australia there is a statutory cap of $40,000.00 on damages pursuant to s s127(b)(i) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA). \nGiven average weekly earnings of women have increased eight times since the enactment of the ADA, the failure of the legislature to increase the caps over time, has rendered the quantum of damages recoverable pursuant to these caps manifestly inadequate in both deterring offenders and compensating victims for harm they have suffered20 . \nFurther, the effect of the statutory caps is that only the very worst examples of sexual harassment attract an award of damages of this magnitude. Maurice Blackburn is of the view that statutory caps on damages under state legislation should be abolished to reflect the federal jurisdiction. \nvi. The Complaints Process \nIn addition to the limitations of the statutory framework set out above, from our experience, the Individual Complaints System itself can be ineffective at achieving a just result for complainants. \nOur primary and overriding submission in relation to the Individual Complaints System is that it is paramount that the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its statutory objectives. \nBelow we have identified three additional issues which impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process. They are related to: \nScarcity of data on mediations; \nEmployer tactics; and \nThe mediation process \nThese are discussed in more detail below: \nScarcity of Data on Mediations \nIt should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined the outcomes of the mediation process with respect to anti-discrimination matters, and even less with respect to sexual harassment matters specifically. This is largely due to \nthe lack of data available given claims that are settled are often the subject of confidentially terms 21 or settled outside (including after) the AHRC process and not reported. \n19 Therese MacDermott (2015)  Reassessing Sexual Harassment: It's time  Alternative Law Journal, 40(3), 157. \n20 Harassment compensation caps outdated in #MeToo era \nThe scarcity of data and the deficiencies in the currently published data have led to a situation where a significant barrier to commencing proceedings or filing a complaint is the inaccuracy of the quantum of reported settlements. \nIt is our experience that men and women who have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace will obtain settlements well into the 6 figure mark as a result of mediation or private negotiations. \nDespite this, the data reported on the AHRC website (which appears to have last been updated in 2016), together with, a study conducted by Worley, Charlesworth and Macdonald22 found that during mediation financial compensation was paid in 72 percent of cases they examined, with the median quantum being $7000.00. \nBetter settlement data (including on post mediation outcomes) needs to be obtained, maintained and published by the AHRC so that complainants can understand that there are available remedies which sound in real compensation being negotiated that may go some way to compensating the victims of sexual harassment for the hurt, humiliation, distress and financial losses that they have suffered. \nIn addition, a tactic commonly used by employers to drive up complainant s costs or to discourage commencement in court is to make very low offers at the mediation stage, irrespective of their risk exposure. This is done on the assumption that complainants cannot afford to pursue the complaints process past mediation. \nGiven there is no risk of the imposition of a fine or a penalty, there is little incentive for employers to make reasonable settlement offers early in the mediation stage. \nAccordingly, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the SDA should be amended so that in addition to compensation, penalties are also payable by respondents who are found liable for sexual harassment. \nPenalties are a common feature of the industrial relations landscape in Australia and would have a necessary deterrent effect. They would also overcome the challenge many complainants face (especially those who are low paid and can therefore expect a lower award of damages for economic loss) of having little leverage during the mediation process, especially if they are not financially placed to engage in lengthy and costly litigation. \n21 Worley, Charlesworth and McDonald (2013)  Why do some sexual harassment complaints settle while others don t   Alternative Law Journal 38(2), 96-102. \nThe Mediation Process \nThe study conducted by Worley, Charlesworth and Macdonald23 found that a number of factors influenced the outcome including differences in the manner in which mediators conducted the mediation, whether the complainant had found another job and of course the level of harm and distress they had suffered. \nIt is our observation that the approach taken to mediation in the AHRC is for a mediator to take a light touch and express no view as to the merits of a claim or, conversely, as to the potential liability and risk of a respondent to a claim. In our view, a more robust approach to mediation should be adopted in the interests of increasing settlements at mediation. \nProcess after Complaint lodged \nOur experience assisting complainants in the mediation process facilitated by the AHRC, is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with. \nThis results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process. In most instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3 and 12 months to have a complaint scheduled for mediation and sometimes months to even have a matter allocated to a mediator. In this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma they have suffered as a result of the harassing behaviour. \nIn order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act should be amended to expressly prescribe time frames for the scheduling of mediation conferences. This would allow complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a reasonable period of time. \nWhile we acknowledge that a level of informality and flexibility is highly desirable in dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment matters, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that a higher level of certainty with respect to how the mediation conferences are conducted should be given to complainants. \nCurrently, participation in the mediation process with the AHRC is voluntary for respondents. In our observation this leads to claimants being further traumatised by the actions of their employers - who either do not file a response or do not attend mediation or prevaricate regarding same. \nMaurice Blackburn is of the view that in order to encourage respondents and employers to participate in the mediation process in meaningful, constructive and useful way, the AHRC Act should be amended to make it mandatory for respondents to attend the mediation conference and to file a reply document in a specified period of time. \nMaurice Blackburn further submits that the AHRC should consider the establishment of a victim advocate role within the AHRC to represent individuals at mediations where those individuals cannot achieve access to justice. We recognise that this service would need to be subject to some form of means test and/or other criteria (by way of example - refugee status, \nor ATSI, CALD or LGBTQI status). Whilst being potentially invaluable for victims of workplace sexual harassment, this may have broader carriage within AHRC. \nFurther, it is our view that claimants should be able to elect to bypass the AHRC and proceed straight to Court. The decision to take such a bold step would necessarily be influenced by the anticipated attitude of an employer and the length of time likely taken to get a mediation at the AHRC. \nOur submissions in response to ToR 4: \nThat the SDA should impose a positive obligation on employers to take all reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment occurring in the workplace, whether an incident has occurred or not. \nThat State and Territory WHS authorities be explicitly authorised to investigate and impose sanctions on employers who have breached their duty to provide safe and without risk workplaces, particularly in the context of sexual harassment. \nThat State and Territory WHS authorities be appropriately resourced to investigate and prosecute risks to health and safety arising from sexual harassment. \nThat trade unions be granted the authority to prosecute for health and safety breaches reinstated where such rights have been removed. \nThat the AHRC recommend a process for formally requiring that reporting of sexual harassment claims and statistics be made to the board of the defined entity and to an external organisation. \nThat businesses should also be required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their reporting requirements to WGEA. \nThat the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (2017) should be repealed and that the time for making complaints should be amended to 6 years in line with other discrimination jurisdictions. \nThat the time limit imposed by s46PH(b) of the AHRC Act should be abolished, especially with respect to sexual harassment complaints. \nThat AHRC explore the insertion of statutory criteria to be taken into account by the Courts when determining an award of damages. \nThat the SDA should be amended so that in addition to compensation, penalties are also payable by respondents who are found liable for sexual harassment. \nThat the AHRC Act should be amended to expressly prescribe time frames for the scheduling of mediation conferences. \nThat the AHRC Act should be amended to make it mandatory for respondents to attend the mediation conference and to file a reply document within a specified period of time. \nThat the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its statutory objectives. \nThat AHRC consider the establishment of a victim advocate role within the AHRC to conduct mediations for those who cannot achieve access to justice. \nThat a complainant be given the right to elect to bypass the AHRC and proceed straight to court. \n5. Existing measures and good practice being undertaken by employers in preventing and responding to workplace sexual harassment, both domestically and internationally. \nNo response to this Term of Reference \n6. The impacts on individuals and business of sexual harassment, such as mental health, and the economic impacts such as workers compensation claims, employee turnover and absenteeism. \nIt is our experience that victims of sexual harassment will suffer some form of mental health effect (including but not limited to a formal diagnosis of depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder). The effects of these illnesses are lifelong and will be felt not just by a victim but by their loved ones. \nIn our observation, the trauma inflicted by sexual harassment is rarely transient and can have flow on effects for the duration of a person s working life. \nThis will often play out by an individual having to take sick leave or make a workers compensation claim given the effect of their health. In many circumstances, it will impair a person s ability to work. In the most serious of cases, involving sexual assault, some of our clients have needed to be institutionalised and their treating medical practitioners have indicated that they may never work again (or may never return to their chosen career) or may only ever work reduced hours. \nOf course, the effects of this trauma on entire families cannot be underestimated with many of our clients reporting a loss of enjoyment of life and the inability to interact with loved ones including children. \nIn our view, prevention is key. \n7. Recommendations to address sexual harassment in Australian workplaces. \nMaurice Blackburn makes the following recommendations: \nThat changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment must include enforceable sanctions against employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees. \nThat AHRC should consider ways that employers can assist in creating a workplace where exposure to discussion and engagement via social media platforms does not impact an employee s right to a safe work environment. \nThat AHRC investigate how a criminal code and a civil regime to combat on-line sexual harassment in Australia might be implemented. \nThat any discussion on criminality and penalties designed to combat on-line sexual harassment must also recognise that it is important to give individuals the legal tools to allow them to: \nSeek injunctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on-line sexual harassment, and \nSeek injunctive relief and damages from the providers and facilitators of online forums where the provider or facilitator has failed to discharge a duty to monitor and protect users. \nThat the SDA should impose a positive obligation on employers to take all reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment occurring in the workplace, whether an incident has occurred or not. \nThat State and Territory WHS authorities be explicitly authorised to investigate and impose sanctions on employers who have breached their duty to provide safe and without risk workplaces, particularly in the context of sexual harassment. \nThat State and Territory WHS authorities be appropriately resourced to investigate and prosecute risks to health and safety arising from sexual harassment. \nThat trade unions be granted the authority to prosecute for health and safety breaches reinstated where such rights have been removed. \nThat the AHRC recommend a process for formally requiring that reporting of sexual harassment claims and statistics be made to the board of the defined entity and to an external organisation. \nThat businesses should also be required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their reporting requirements to WGEA. \nThat the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (2017) should be repealed and that the time for making complaints should be amended to 6 years in line with other discrimination jurisdictions. \nThat the time limit imposed by s46PH(b) of the AHRC Act should be abolished, especially with respect to sexual harassment complaints. \nThat AHRC explore the insertion of statutory criteria to be taken into account by the Courts when determining an award of damages. \nThat the SDA should be amended so that in addition to compensation, penalties are also payable by respondents who are found liable for sexual harassment. \nThat the AHRC Act should be amended to expressly prescribe time frames for the scheduling of mediation conferences. \nThat the AHRC Act should be amended to make it mandatory for respondents to attend the mediation conference and to file a reply document within a specified period of time. \nThat the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its statutory objectives. \nThat AHRC consider the establishment of a victim advocate role within the AHRC to conduct mediations for those who cannot achieve access to justice. \nThat a complainant be given the right to elect to bypass the AHRC and proceed straight to court. \n"
