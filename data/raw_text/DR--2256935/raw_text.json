    "raw_text": "TCP Reports Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results \nAURORA, Ohio, Aug. 7, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- TCP International Holdings Ltd. (NYSE: TCPI), a leading global manufacturer and distributor of energy efficient lighting technologies, today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2014. \nNet sales for the second quarter were $112.5 million, an 11% increase compared with $101.1 million in the first quarter of 2014 and a 1% increase compared with $111.2 million in the second quarter of 2013.  Net income in the second quarter was $2.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with $3.9 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2014 and compared with $4.6 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2013. \n\"Our sales for the second quarter reflected our ongoing success to expand our LED product line in both our commercial and industrial and retail sales channels,\" said Ellis Yan, TCP's Chairman and CEO.  \"Moving forward, we expect to leverage the investments we have made in our people and infrastructure to drive the continued growth of our LED product line.\" \nSecond Quarter 2014 Summary \nFollowing is a summary of certain key financial measures for the second quarter of 2014: \nNet sales were $112.5 million, an increase of $11.4 million, or 11%, from the first quarter of 2014 and an increase of $1.3 million, or 1%, from the second quarter of 2013. \nLED sales were $46.0 million, an increase of $9.7 million, or 27%, from the first quarter of 2014 and an increase of $18.2 million, or 65%, from the second quarter of 2013, driven by increased sales in the commercial and industrial, or C&I, channel and with Walmart. \nCFL sales were $59.5 million, roughly flat from the first quarter of 2014 and down $12.4 million, or 17%, from the second quarter of 2013, primarily due to the transition to LEDs in the C&I channel and lower volume with The Home Depot. \nGross margin was 22.7%, down from 24.5% in the first quarter of 2014 and down from 24.3% in the second quarter of 2013 due to the absence of favorable profit margins on a one-time order in 2013 and an increase in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory.   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $20.4 million, an increase of $3.5 million from the first quarter of 2014 and an increase of $3.8 million from the second quarter of 2013 due to higher payroll largely attributable to the expansion of our sales force and marketing team to serve the C&I channel, increased marketing costs, and share-based compensation expenses for new awards granted in connection with the IPO. \nNet income was $2.0 million, a decrease from $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2014 and a decrease from $4.6 million in the second quarter of 2013.  Diluted earnings per share were $0.10, a decrease from diluted earnings per share of $0.19 in the first quarter of 2014 and a decrease from diluted earnings per share of $0.22 in the second quarter of 2013. \nAdjusted EBITDA was $7.7 million, compared to $10.0 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $12.4 million in the second quarter of 2013. \nAt June 30, 2014, cash and cash equivalents were $16.1 million, down from $23.0 million at March 31, 2014. On July 1, 2014, TCP completed an initial public offering generating proceeds of $78.6 million, before deducting expenses of the offering estimated at $8.8 million.  On a pro forma basis, after giving effect of the offering that will be recorded in the third quarter of 2014, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were $85.9 million. Combined short-term loans and long-term debt was $144.2 million at June 30, 2014, down from $146.8 million at March 31, 2014.  We intend to use the net proceeds from our offering to acquire manufacturing equipment to expand our LED manufacturing capacity, for the repayment of indebtedness outstanding and for general corporate purposes. \nConference Call and Webcast Information \nhttp://investors.tcpi.com\nThe Company will host a conference call today, August 7, 2014, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time).

This non-GAAP financial measure is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), and should be viewed as a supplement to, not a substitute for, our results of operations presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before net foreign currency losses (gains), litigation settlements, share-based compensation expense and other non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA may exclude certain financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be indicative of historical operating results, and we do not intend for it to be predictive of future results of operations. We believe the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a metric assists our board, management and investors in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis because it removes the impact of our capital structure (i.e., interest expense), asset base (i.e., depreciation and amortization) and tax structure, as well as certain items that affect inter-period comparability. \nTCP is a leading global manufacturer and distributor of energy efficient lighting technologies.
