            "One nal agent-based model which is often compared to nancial markets is the minority game.53 This is a repeated game in which agents must chose one of two doors, left or right.\nIf the minority of agents choses left this group wins, and if the minority chose right this group wins.\nThe connection to nance is through the notion of contrarian strategies, where it is best to move against the herd.\nConnecting this model to nance is a controversial subject since its basic version does not have a natural role for prices.\nAlso, it would appear that the contrary nature of the minority game is somewhat forced, and in real nancial markets it may be better to follow the herd for a short period of time.\nAn interesting application of the minority game to nancial data is Johnson, Lamper, Jeeries, Hart & Howison (2001).\nIn this model the authors convert a nancial series into a binary string depending on whether the price rises or falls.\nThe agents play the game for many periods watching, the real nancial time series as the input into their rule selection process.\nThe agents are then allowed to continue playing the game after the price series is shut o, and the continued model dynamics are used in a kind of out of sample forecasting context.\nThey are able to produce some small forecasting gains in some high frequency data.\nIt remains to be seen how robust and reliable these numbers are, but this is an interesting test of the minority game model on real data.54",
            "At the end of each period, each trader with probability p engages in a learning process to update his current set of forecasting rules for the next period and with probability (1  p) leaves his current set of forecasting rules unchanged.\nThe probability, p, is an important model parameter that determines the average number of periods between learning for each trader as a function K = K(p).\nThis K is referred to as the learning rate.\nLearning takes place with a modied genetic algorithm (GA) designed to handle both the real and binary components of the rule sets.\nThe worst performing 15 percent of the rules are dropped out of an agents rule set, and are replaced by new rules.\nNew rules are generated using a genetic algorithm with uniform crossover and mutation.\nFor the bitstring part of the rules, crossover chooses two t rules as parents, and takes bits from each parents rule string at random.35 Mutation involves changing the individual bits at random.\nCrossover also is implemented on the real components of the forecasting rules too.\nThis is one of the earlier applications of a real-valued crossover operator in nance.",
