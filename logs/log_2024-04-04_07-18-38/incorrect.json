The web page includes information about meetings, activities, officer contact information, upcoming conferences, available jobs, and section news. The site always has the current and upcoming meeting information posted, and on-line registration for Section meetings continued to be both popular and successful. In addition, electronic download of the registration information were used to produce the registration list, name badges and written receipts for any specific event. This form of registration has proven to be very effective and user friendly for members.": [

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, nance witnessed a revolution.\nThe advent of the ecient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the eld on a new, solid scientic foundation.\nThis world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available.\nAt the core of asset pricing, ecient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to nancial economists as it is potentially unappealing to nancial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension.\nThe early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new nancial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about nancial markets.\nThis time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may dier in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",
