       " 'Following a Joint Parliamentary Committee inquiry into freedom of speech (JPC Inquiry) in April 2017 the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (2017) (the Amendment) was passed by both houses of Parliament.\\nOne of the most significant effects of the Amendment was to amend s46PH of the AHRC Act so that a complaint, including a complaint in relation to sexual harassment, can be terminated by the President of the AHRC if it is lodged more than 6 months after the alleged events took place.',\n",
       " 'The effect of this change is significant.\\nWhile this time limit does not operate in the same way as a statutory limitation period does, the effect of a decision of the President to terminate the complaint is that a complainant loses access to the confidential mediation process facilitated by the AHRC.\\nThe benefit of having access to the AHRCs mediation process is that it allows victims of sexual harassment, whom typically have restricted access to the law, the opportunity to engage in a relatively low cost, less adversarial dispute resolution process.',\n",
       " 'Maurice Blackburn submits the Amendment should be repealed and that the time for making complaints should be amended to 6 years in line with other employment law jurisdictions.\\nThis submission is made for the following reasons:\\n There is no sound policy reason for imposing the time period on complaints;\\n A six-month time period is out of step with other Australian employment law jurisdictions; and\\n Reducing access to an informal, low-cost dispute resolution process has a negative impact on the efficient resolution of complaints.',\n",
       " 'These are elaborated upon below:\\nThere is no sound policy reason for the new time limit.\\nAt the time the Amendment was passed, there was no clear policy rationale put forward by the legislature for the change to the time limit, save for the apparent need to mitigate unmeritorious or vexatious claims being made14.\\nThe JPC Inquiry recommended that the AHRC adopt time limits for the processes related to complaint handling activities at the initial assessment of the complaint15.\\nHowever, this recommendation did not extend to reducing the time limit a complainant has to lodge a complaint16.',\n",

       " 'Maurice Blackburn is of the view that these statistics demonstrate two things:\\n Given that underreporting remains high, it may be the case that the majority of victims require more than 6 months to make a complaint; and\\n It is simply not the case that a large number of victims report sexual harassment a long time after it has occurred, so as to justify the imposition of the 6 month time restriction as a deterrence for a large number of unmeritorious complaints.',\n",
       " 'This means that in addition to there being no sound policy reason for the time period for lodging sexual harassment complaints with the AHRC being reduced to 6 months, there is a strong case for the time period being extended beyond the 12 month period that is placed on complaints in different jurisdictions, and which existed before the Amendment was enacted.\\nFor this reason, the time limit imposed by s46PH(b) of the AHRC Act should be abolished, especially with respect to sexual harassment complaints.',\n",
       " 'We are of the view that the 6 year time limitation period that applies to other kinds of discrimination matters in the Fair Work jurisdiction should apply to complaints made by the AHRC, particularly for sexual harassment complaints.\\nAdditionally, there are sufficient grounds under s46PH of the AHRC Act that allow the President to terminate a complaint where the complaint is without merit or is better dealt with in another jurisdiction, without the inclusion of s46PH(b).',\n",
       " 'Indeed, s46PH(c) provides the President with very broad powers to terminate a complaint in circumstances where having regard to all the circumstances, that an inquiry, or the continuation of an inquiry, into the complaint is not warranted.\\nWe submit that if there is a legitimate concern that a complaint was without merit for any reason, the President is still able to exercise his/her power to terminate it under this provision.',\n",
       " 'The 6 month time limit is particularly short when compared with similar jurisdictions that deal with discrimination or employment law issues.\\nBy way of comparison, the discrimination provisions of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) allow discrimination claims to be dealt with by the Fair Work Commission provided that they are brought within 6 years of the alleged events occurring, where the complaint does not involve dismissal.',\n",
       " 'Further, the Anti-Discrimination Act 1975 (NSW), only allows the President of the Anti- Discrimination Board to terminate a complaint if it is brought more than 12 months after the alleged events occurred.\\nMaurice Blackburn is of the view, that 12 months is a particularly short time period, but 6 months is simply unjustified.',\n",
       " 'The damages awarded in sexual harassment matters have historically been significantly lower than comparable jurisdictions in which an applicant suffers an illness as a result of unlawful conduct.\\nWhile this trend was disturbed somewhat after the decision in Richardson v Oracle Corporation Australia Pty Ltd18 (Oracle), where the complainant was awarded $130,000.00 the detrimental impact of historically low awards of damages should not be underestimated.',\n",
       " 'Indeed, at the time of writing, there is an absence of a significant body of case law which supports the approach taken by the Federal Court of Appeal, in Oracle.\\nWhile subsequent cases have referenced Oracles emphasis on changing community standards to support the rationale behind increasing awards of damages, this rationale has not been reflected in the quantum awarded to complainants.',\n",
       " 'Further, our experience in assisting clients navigate the legal process with respect to sexual harassment complaints suggests that the low awards of damages has an additional deterrent effect when a complainant is making a decision to file a complaint with the AHRC or commence litigation.\\n18 [2014] FCAFC 82.\\nWhile damages are assessed in a similar way to tortious common law claims, given claimants rights emerge from statute, there may be scope for providing more specific statutory guidance as to the appropriate quantum in respect of awards of damages.',\n",
       " 'For example, it has been argued that an increased focus on exemplary damages, rather than compensatory damages would better reflect the moral wrong caused by the conduct and have a greater deterrent effect on perpetrators19.\\nOne possible reform to remedy this issue would be the insertion of statutory criteria to be taken into account by the Courts when determining an award of damages.',\n",
       " 'In NSW there is a statutory cap of $100,000.00 pursuant to s108(7) of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 (NSW) (the ADA). In Western Australia there is a statutory cap of $40,000.00 on damages pursuant to s s127(b)(i) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA).\\nGiven average weekly earnings of women have increased eight times since the enactment of the ADA, the failure of the legislature to increase the caps over time, has rendered the quantum of damages recoverable pursuant to these caps manifestly inadequate in both deterring offenders and compensating victims for harm they have suffered20.',\n",
       " 'Further, the effect of the statutory caps is that only the very worst examples of sexual harassment attract an award of damages of this magnitude.\\nMaurice Blackburn is of the view that statutory caps on damages under state legislation should be abolished to reflect the federal jurisdiction.',\n",
       " 'In addition to the limitations of the statutory framework set out above, from our experience, the Individual Complaints System itself can be ineffective at achieving a just result for complainants.\\nOur primary and overriding submission in relation to the Individual Complaints System is that it is paramount that the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its statutory objectives.\\nBelow we have identified three additional issues which impact the efficacy of the Complaints Process.\\nThey are related to:\\n Scarcity of data on mediations;\\n Employer tactics; and\\n The mediation process',\n",
       " \"It should be noted that there have been very few Australian studies which have examined the outcomes of the mediation process with respect to anti-discrimination matters, and even less with respect to sexual harassment matters specifically.\\nThis is largely due to 19 Therese MacDermott (2015) Reassessing Sexual Harassment: It's time Alternative Law Journal, 40(3), 157.\\n20 Harassment compensation caps outdated in #MeToo era the lack of data available given claims that are settled are often the subject of confidentially terms21 or settled outside (including after) the AHRC process and not reported.\",\n",
       " 'The scarcity of data and the deficiencies in the currently published data have led to a situation where a significant barrier to commencing proceedings or filing a complaint is the inaccuracy of the quantum of reported settlements.\\nIt is our experience that men and women who have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace will obtain settlements well into the 6 figure mark as a result of mediation or private negotiations.',\n",
       " 'Despite this, the data reported on the AHRC website (which appears to have last been updated in 2016), together with, a study conducted by Worley, Charlesworth and Macdonald22 found that during mediation financial compensation was paid in 72 percent of cases they examined, with the median quantum being $7000.00.',\n",
       " 'Better settlement data (including on post mediation outcomes) needs to be obtained, maintained and published by the AHRC so that complainants can understand that there are available remedies which sound in real compensation being negotiated that may go some way to compensating the victims of sexual harassment for the hurt, humiliation, distress and financial losses that they have suffered.\\nEmployer tactics',\n",
       " 'In addition, a tactic commonly used by employers to drive up complainants costs or to discourage commencement in court is to make very low offers at the mediation stage, irrespective of their risk exposure.\\nThis is done on the assumption that complainants cannot afford to pursue the complaints process past mediation.\\nGiven there is no risk of the imposition of a fine or a penalty, there is little incentive for employers to make reasonable settlement offers early in the mediation stage.',\n",
       " 'Accordingly, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the SDA should be amended so that in addition to compensation, penalties are also payable by respondents who are found liable for sexual harassment.',\n",
       " 'Penalties are a common feature of the industrial relations landscape in Australia and would have a necessary deterrent effect.\\nThey would also overcome the challenge many complainants face (especially those who are low paid and can therefore expect a lower award of damages for economic loss) of having little leverage during the mediation process, especially if they are not financially placed to engage in lengthy and costly litigation.\\n21 Worley, Charlesworth and McDonald (2013) Why do some sexual harassment complaints settle while others dont?\\nAlternative Law Journal 38(2), 96-102.',\n",
       " 'The study conducted by Worley, Charlesworth and Macdonald23 found that a number of factors influenced the outcome including differences in the manner in which mediators conducted the mediation, whether the complainant had found another job and of course the level of harm and distress they had suffered.',\n",
       " 'It is our observation that the approach taken to mediation in the AHRC is for a mediator to take a light touch and express no view as to the merits of a claim or, conversely, as to the potential liability and risk of a respondent to a claim.\\nIn our view, a more robust approach to mediation should be adopted in the interests of increasing settlements at mediation.\\nProcess after Complaint lodged Our experience assisting complainants in the mediation process facilitated by the AHRC, is that there is an unsatisfactorily slow rate at which complaints are dealt with.',\n",
       " 'This results in complainants feeling fatigued and worn down by the process.\\nIn most instances, our experience has been that it takes between 3 and 12 months to have a complaint scheduled for mediation and sometimes months to even have a matter allocated to a mediator.\\nIn this time, complainants find it difficult to move on with their lives and take steps toward overcoming the trauma they have suffered as a result of the harassing behaviour.',\n",
       " 'In order to address this concern, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that the AHRC Act should be amended to expressly prescribe time frames for the scheduling of mediation conferences.\\nThis would allow complainants to have their complaint dealt with in a reasonable period of time.\\nWhile we acknowledge that a level of informality and flexibility is highly desirable in dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment matters, Maurice Blackburn is of the view that a higher level of certainty with respect to how the mediation conferences are conducted should be given to complainants.',\n",
       " 'Currently, participation in the mediation process with the AHRC is voluntary for respondents.\\nIn our observation this leads to claimants being further traumatised by the actions of their employers - who either do not file a response or do not attend mediation or prevaricate regarding same.',\n",
       " 'Maurice Blackburn is of the view that in order to encourage respondents and employers to participate in the mediation process in meaningful, constructive and useful way, the AHRC Act should be amended to make it mandatory for respondents to attend the mediation conference and to file a reply document in a specified period of time.',\n",
       " 'Maurice Blackburn further submits that the AHRC should consider the establishment of a victim advocate role within the AHRC to represent individuals at mediations where those individuals cannot achieve access to justice.\\nWe recognise that this service would need to be subject to some form of means test and/or other criteria (by way of example - refugee status, or ATSI, CALD or LGBTQI status).\\nWhilst being potentially invaluable for victims of workplace sexual harassment, this may have broader carriage within AHRC.',\n",
       " 'Further, it is our view that claimants should be able to elect to bypass the AHRC and proceed straight to Court.\\nThe decision to take such a bold step would necessarily be influenced by the anticipated attitude of an employer and the length of time likely taken to get a mediation at the AHRC.\\nOur submissions in response to ToR 4: That the SDA should impose a positive obligation on employers to take all reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment occurring in the workplace, whether an incident has occurred or not.',\n",

       " 'It is our experience that victims of sexual harassment will suffer some form of mental health effect (including but not limited to a formal diagnosis of depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder).\\nThe effects of these illnesses are lifelong and will be felt not just by a victim but by their loved ones.\\nIn our observation, the trauma inflicted by sexual harassment is rarely transient and can have flow on effects for the duration of a persons working life.',\n",
       " 'This will often play out by an individual having to take sick leave or make a workers compensation claim given the effect of their health.\\nIn many circumstances, it will impair a persons ability to work.\\nIn the most serious of cases, involving sexual assault, some of our clients have needed to be institutionalised and their treating medical practitioners have indicated that they may never work again (or may never return to their chosen career) or may only ever work reduced hours.',\n",

That changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment must include enforceable sanctions against employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.\\n2. That AHRC should consider ways that employers can assist in creating a workplace where exposure to discussion and engagement via social media platforms does not impact an employees right to a safe work environment.\\n3. That AHRC investigate how a criminal code and a civil regime to combat on-line sexual harassment in Australia might be implemented.\\n4. That any discussion on criminality and penalties designed to combat on-line sexual harassment must also recognise that it is important to give individuals the legal tools to allow them to:\\n Seek injunctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on-line sexual harassment, and\\n Seek injunctive relief and damages from the providers and facilitators of online forums where the provider or facilitator has failed to discharge a duty to monitor and protect users.\\n5.

       " 'In the mid to later part of the 20th century, nance witnessed a revolution.\\nThe advent of the ecient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the eld on a new, solid scientic foundation.\\nThis world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available.\\nAt the core of asset pricing, ecient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to nancial economists as it is potentially unappealing to nancial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension.\\nThe early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new nancial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about nancial markets.\\nThis time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may dier in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.',\n",

       " 'Academic nance has debated the issue of market eciency for some time.\\nThe concept of market eciency has a strong theoretical and empirical backing which should not be ignored.5 On the theoretical side, the argument is that traders with less than rational strategies will disappear, and if prices contain any predictable components either in their own past series, or connected to fundamentals, the remaining rational investors will reduce these to zero.\\nThis is very close to the evolutionary arguments put forth in both Alchian (1950) and Friedman (1953) for the evolution of rms and rational behavior in general.\\nThis powerful idea still holds sway in much of the academic nancial world, and can be seen in papers such as Rubenstein (2001).\\nAs appealing as this idea is, it is interesting to note that there never really has been a truly accepted dynamical process describing how market eciency comes about.\\nThe second foundation for ecient market theories, supported by much of the early empirical work on nancial markets, is that markets are much more unpredictable than the world of the nancial practitioner suggests.6 In this early literature, the random walk model appeared to be a pretty good approximation for the movements of stock prices, and it can be argued that the same holds true today.\\nWe know that markets are probably not completely unpredictable, but they still are very dicult to forecast.7 The early ideas of ecient markets were made more formal as modern tools of dynamic optimization were brought to bear on these problems.8 This led to an even stronger representation for nancial markets, the representative agent.9 This model formally connects asset prices to the beliefs of a single aggregate individual who can then be linked to various state variables of the macroeconomy.',\n",

Another important issue that is brought up is the stability of a given agent-based models results to the addition of new trading strategies.\\nSpecically, are there strategies that would smoke out obvious patterns in the data and change the dynamics?\\nAgent-based models are trying to continuously defend against this with the continuously learning agents, but something outside the learning structure is possible.\\nAn initial defense of this is that most markets generate very little autocorrelation and therefore yield no obvious arbitrage opportunities for new trading strategies to exploit.\\nHowever, there is a possibility that more complex nonlinear strategies could detect such opportunities.\\nArifovic (2001) is an example testing this sort of issue, and nds that the more complicated agents do not do better in her simulated market environment.\\nThis problem is still one of the most important for agent-based modelers to worry about, and no one should feel immune to this criticism.',\n",
       " 'Another very common and pertinent criticism is that most agent-based nancial market models assume a small number of assets.\\nOften agents trade only one risky asset, and one risk-free asset alone.55 It is certainly true that, with all of the new methodological tools in use in these models, it was important to start with the simplifying case of one risky and one risk-free asset.\\nHowever, this simplication may eliminate many interesting features.\\nThe criticisms of models with a single representative agent may carry over equally well to models with a single representative risky asset.\\nQuestions naturally arise about calibrating to aggregate dividends, and exactly what this calibration means, since aggregate dividends are not paid by any single stock.\\nAlso, recent events such as the technology bubble of the 1990s remind us that bubbles are often very sector dependent.\\nFinally, when thinking about trading volume, it is really necessary to have a multi-asset world where traders are allowed to move back and forth between stocks.\\nThe single asset market puts an extreme restriction on the amount of trading volume that can be generated in a simulated market.\\nAnother related problem is that, even though most agent-based markets have two assets, they actually shut down pricing in one market.\\nIn many cases the risk-free rate is xed, hence the market is not a general equilibrium model.\\nThis is problematic in that explaining the level and volatility of the risk-free asset itself has been another asset pricing puzzle.\\nGetting the risk-free rate to be as low and stable as it is in actual macro 55Two recent exceptions to this are Chiarella, Dieci & l. Gardini (2004) and Westerho (forthcoming 2004).\\nAlso, Levy et al.\\n(2000) perform some experiments in multi-asset settings with options.',\n",
       " 'data is not easy, and most agent-based models simply avoid this problem completely.\\nEndogenously opening multiple markets for trading is still a dicult problem, but it needs to be addressed at some point.\\nOnce researchers are more condent they have mastered agent-based modeling tools, they will probably tackle multi-asset market modeling more frequently.',\n",
       " 'Egenter, Lux & Stauer (1999) address another interesting question for agent-based modelers to consider.\\nWhat happens as the number of agents is increased?\\nThey have performed some tests on models that can be studied analytically, and they nd that the dynamics can change dramatically as the number of agents becomes large.\\nWhat initially looks like random behavior for a small numbers of agents can become increasingly predictable as the number of agents becomes very large.\\nIs it possible that many of the nice features that many models display are artifacts of the limitation to relatively small numbers of traders imposed by computer modeling?\\nThis is a very important question.\\nOne response to this question is that assuming an innite number of agents might not be realistic in some settings.\\nThere may be real-world market situations in which the thinness of the market is an important and critical issue for the determination of the markets dynamics.\\nThis issue will denitely be an important one for the eld to tackle in the future.',\n",
       " 'Almost all of the agents that are modeled and discussed in this survey operate inductively.\\nThey adopt rules and forecasts which have performed well in the recent past, and they adjust these rules and forecasts to perform better in the future.\\nThe early spirit of agent-based models is clearly to push away from more traditional deductive styles of learning and towards more inductive styles of learning.\\nHowever, it is often asked if there still may be a role for some form of deductive reasoning.\\nIs it going too far to think of agents simply looking for patterns in the past and using behaviors that have worked in the past?\\nCan they be allowed to do some form of deductive reasoning?\\nCan they learn commonly held theories in nance, such as present value analysis, or the Black-Scholes option pricing formula?\\nAn interesting question is whether an agent-based model can be constructed that allows for a little deductive reasoning while keeping the general inductive spirit of simple rules of thumb.',\n",
       " 'A nal problem, often ignored, is timing.\\nAlmost all agent-based models need to make explicit assumptions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade.\\nOf course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously.\\nIn the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out.\\nThe degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is denitely important.\\nOne example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market.\\nIt is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specic timing and trading structures.\\nIt will be interesting to see if agent-based nancial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an impact on any of the early results.',\n",
       " 'This paper has given an overview of the current state of research in agent-based computational nance along with some ideas concerning the design and construction of working simulations.\\nIt is important to note that this is a very young eld, and it still shows the kind of open-ended exploratory nature of such an endeavor.\\nHowever, several crucial trends are starting to appear.',\n",
       " 'First, the models are beginning to divide into several dierent types.\\nThese range from the few-type models covered in section 3.1, in which traders are assumed to choose from among relatively small xed sets of trading strategies, to the many-type models covered in sections 3.2 and 3.3 in which traders choose from among large and possibly evolving sets of trading strategies.\\nThe few-type models oer an important dimension of tractability relative to the the many-type models, and they often provide denitive connections between parameters and results which might not be seen or noticed in the more complex frameworks, so it is easy to see their appeal.\\nHowever, a key reason for doing computer modeling is that the use of more sophisticated trading strategies in many-type models needs to be understood as well.\\nThere are two basic reasons for this.\\nFirst, many-type models take emergence very seriously in that they do not bias toward any particular strategy loaded ex ante by the researcher.\\nThe strategies that end up being used are those that appear and persist inside a learning structure.\\nThey therefore partially answer a criticism of the few-type models that their specication of trading strategies is ad hoc. Second, they use the computer and the learning algorithms to continuously search the time series record to smoke out new trading opportunities.\\nThis is something that is not present in the few-type models.\\nThe obvious limitation is that their ability to seek out and take advantage of any ineciencies that may appear depends critically on the data representations and implementations of the learning algorithms.\\nFew-type and many-type models clearly each have both strengths and weaknesses that users should take into account.',\n",
       " 'Up to this point very little reference has been made to the growing literature on behavioral nance.\\nIt is important to dene where agent-based nancial markets sit relative to this larger eld.\\nFirst, they are clearly behavioral models themselves, since the agents are boundedly rational and follow simple rules of thumb.\\nThis is a key characteristic of any behavioral model, and agent-based models have this characteristic.\\nWhere agent-based nancial market models have diverged to date from behavioral nance models is their typical presumption that agent preferences have relatively standard representations.\\nTypically, no attempt is made to model common behavioral biases such as loss aversion or hyperbolic discounting.\\nThis is not because agent-based models cannot handle these behavioral aspects.\\nRather, it has just seemed sensible in this early stage of the eld to refrain from adding too many more complications to models which are already very complicated.\\nIt is important to note that agent-based technologies are well suited for testing behavioral theories.\\nThey can answer two key questions that should be asked of any behavioral structure.\\nFirst, how well do behavioral biases hold up under aggregation; and second, which types of biases will survive in a coevolutionary struggle against others.\\nTherefore, the connections between agent-based approaches and behavioral approaches will probably become more intertwined as both elds progress.',\n",
       " 'Whether computational or not, all of the models mentioned in this survey share a common tie to ideas from nonlinear dynamics and chaos.\\nThe relationship between model structure and noise in nonlinear systems can be very complicated, and these markets share this feature.\\nIn many cases the markets operate as noise magniers, taking a small amount of input noise, or underlying fundamental risk, and increasing its level to a much larger observed macro value.\\nNoise can also help to stabilize a nonlinear system by keeping it o unstable trajectories.\\nAs is well known, nonlinear systems can also be dicult to forecast, and most of the markets described here share this feature.\\nUnfortunately, this may also make them dicult to estimate using traditional econometric tools.\\nAgent-based modelers should be aware of these nonlinear issues, and take them into account when evaluating market simulations.',\n",
       " 'Agent-based modelers are also starting to move from the more stylized earlier nancial market models toward more models incorporating explicit market microstructure.\\nThe latter try to model very explicitly the actual mechanisms of trade that are being used in the market as opposed to building a stylized trading framework.\\nThese microstructure oriented models are well designed to answer questions concerning the construction and design of these same trading mechanisms.\\nIn some of these markets it is the institutions that are at the center of the investigation, and the agents are just a mechanism for testing their behavior.\\nSome of the policy questions addressed in this work are much more sharply dened than in other agent-based models.\\nAn example of this would be the explorations into decimalization on markets, or the implementation of price limits.\\nFrom a policy perspective this would seem to be a very natural place for the eld to move as it matures.',\n",
       " 'Financial markets are an important challenge for agent-based computational modelers.\\nFinancial markets may be one of the important early areas where agent-based methods show their worth, for two basic reasons.',\n",
