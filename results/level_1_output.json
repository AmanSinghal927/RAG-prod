The computer may or may not be a necessary tool to understand the dynamics of these markets. This survey will concentrate on the cases where analytic solutions would be impossible, and computational tools are necessary.3 It is important to distinguish agent-based models from other more general heterogeneous agent models in finance, since the latter have been part of the field for some time.4 In agent-based financial markets, dynamic heterogeneity is critical. This heterogeneity is represented by a distribution of agents, or wealth, across either a fixed or changing set of strategies. In principle, optimizing agents would respond optimally to this distribution of other agent strategies, but in general, this state space is far too complicated to begin to calculate an optimal strategy, forcing some form of bounded rationality on both agents and the modeler. It is important to note that in these worlds bounded rationality is driven by the complexity of the state space more than the perceived limitations of individual agents.

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",
            "The exchange rate is given by et = p1,t p2,t . (11)",
            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

The computer may or may not be a necessary tool to understand the dynamics of these markets.

This heterogeneity is represented by a distribution of agents, or wealth, across either a fixed or changing set of strategies. In principle, optimizing agents would respond optimally to this distribution of other agent strategies, but in general, this state space is far too complicated to begin to calculate an optimal strategy, forcing some form of bounded rationality on both agents and the modeler. It is important to note that in these worlds bounded rationality is driven by the complexity of the state space more than the perceived limitations of individual agents. It is also important to remember that the simplified rules of thumb used by agents do not suggest that the exercise is forcing some sort of simplified solution on the dynamics of the steady state or the model,",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",
            "The exchange rate is given by et = p1,t p2,t . (11)",
            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",

He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",
            "The exchange rate is given by et = p1,t p2,t . (11)",
            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",
            "The exchange rate is given by et = p1,t p2,t . (11)",
            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "data is not easy, and most agent-based models simply avoid this problem completely.\nEndogenously opening multiple markets for trading is still a dicult problem, but it needs to be addressed at some point.\nOnce researchers are more condent they have mastered agent-based modeling tools, they will probably tackle multi-asset market modeling more frequently.",
            "It is easy to get lost in the many dierent types of models used in agent-based nancial markets.\nSeveral approaches are used, and it is often dicult to distinguish one model from the next.\nThis survey will take an initial stand on trying to categorize the many models that exist in a hope that this will help new researchers to better sort out what is going in the eld.\nAt such an early stage, it is still possible that some may argue about how markets are being categorized, or that some markets belong in multiple categories, or that the categories themselves are wrong.\nMost of the earliest models were intended to create an entire functioning nancial market.\nThey were often referred to as articial nancial markets.\nThe next several subsections deal with dierent parts of this literature.",

            "Up to this point very little reference has been made to the growing literature on behavioral nance.\nIt is important to dene where agent-based nancial markets sit relative to this larger eld.\nFirst, they are clearly behavioral models themselves, since the agents are boundedly rational and follow simple rules of thumb.\nThis is a key characteristic of any behavioral model, and agent-based models have this characteristic.\nWhere agent-based nancial market models have diverged to date from behavioral nance models is their typical presumption that agent preferences have relatively standard representations.\nTypically, no attempt is made to model common behavioral biases such as loss aversion or hyperbolic discounting.\nThis is not because agent-based models cannot handle these behavioral aspects.\nRather, it has just seemed sensible in this early stage of the eld to refrain from adding too many more complications to models which are already very complicated.\nIt is important to note that agent-based technologies are well suited for testing behavioral theories.\nThey can answer two key questions that should be asked of any behavioral structure.\nFirst, how well do behavioral biases hold up under aggregation; and second, which types of biases will survive in a coevolutionary struggle against others.\nTherefore, the connections between agent-based approaches and behavioral approaches will probably become more intertwined as both elds progress."

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",

Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

It is important to note that in these worlds bounded rationality is driven by the complexity of the state space more than the perceived limitations of individual agents. It is also important to remember that the simplified rules of thumb used by agents do not suggest that the exercise is forcing some sort of simplified solution on the dynamics of the steady state or the model,",
            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",
            "The exchange rate is given by et = p1,t p2,t . (11)",
            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",
            "The exchange rate is given by et = p1,t p2,t . (11)",
            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",
            "The exchange rate is given by et = p1,t p2,t . (11)",
            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",
            "The exchange rate is given by et = p1,t p2,t . (11)",
            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "Models in the realm of agent-based computational finance view financial markets as interacting groups of learning, boundedly-rational agents. The computer may or may not be a necessary tool to understand the dynamics of these markets. This survey will concentrate on the cases where analytic solutions would be impossible, and computational tools are necessary.3 It is important to distinguish agent-based models from other more general heterogeneous agent models in finance, since the latter have been part of the field for some time.4 In agent-based financial markets, dynamic heterogeneity is critical. This heterogeneity is represented by a distribution of agents, or wealth, across either a fixed or changing set of strategies. In principle, optimizing agents would respond optimally to this distribution of other agent strategies, but in general, this state space is far too complicated to begin to calculate an optimal strategy, forcing some form of bounded rationality on both agents and the modeler. It is important to note that in these worlds bounded rationality is driven by the complexity of the state space more than the perceived limitations of individual agents.

            "Models in the realm of agent-based computational finance view financial markets as interacting groups of learning, boundedly-rational agents. The computer may or may not be a necessary tool to understand the dynamics of these markets. This survey will concentrate on the cases where analytic solutions would be impossible, and computational tools are necessary.3 It is important to distinguish agent-based models from other more general heterogeneous agent models in finance, since the latter have been part of the field for some time.4 In agent-based financial markets, dynamic heterogeneity is critical. This heterogeneity is represented by a distribution of agents, or wealth, across either a fixed or changing set of strategies. In principle, optimizing agents would respond optimally to this distribution of other agent strategies, but in general, this state space is far too complicated to begin to calculate an optimal strategy, forcing some form of bounded rationality on both agents and the modeler. It is important to note that in these worlds bounded rationality is driven by the complexity of the state space more than the perceived limitations of individual agents. It is also important to remember that the simplified rules of thumb used by agents do not suggest that the exercise is forcing some sort of simplified solution on the dynamics of the steady state or the model,",
            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "financial markets particularly appealing applications agentbased methods several reasons first key debates nance market eciency rationality still unresolved second nancial time series contain many curious puzzles well understood third nancial markets provide wealth pricing volume data analyzed fourth considering evolution nancial markets provide good approximation crude tness measure wealth return performance finally strong connections relevant experimental results cases operate time scales actual nancial markets",
            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",
            "The exchange rate is given by et = p1,t p2,t . (11)",
            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",
            "The exchange rate is given by et = p1,t p2,t . (11)",
            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

This heterogeneity is represented by a distribution of agents, or wealth, across either a fixed or changing set of strategies. In principle, optimizing agents would respond optimally to this distribution of other agent strategies, but in general, this state space is far too complicated to begin to calculate an optimal strategy, forcing some form of bounded rationality on both agents and the modeler. It is important to note that in these worlds bounded rationality is driven by the complexity of the state space more than the perceived limitations of individual agents. It is also important to remember that the simplified rules of thumb used by agents do not suggest that the exercise is forcing some sort of simplified solution on the dynamics of the steady state or the model,",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",
            "The exchange rate is given by et = p1,t p2,t . (11)",
            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",

He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "extreme, agents may operate completely on their own, learning rules over time, and only reacting with others through common price and information variables.\nHowever, in nancial settings it may be useful to try to implement some form of communication across agents, or even to transfer rule-based information across individuals from generation to generation.\nHow this information transfer is handled may be critical in market dynamics; these information correlations cause eventual strategy correlations, which can translate into large price movements and other features suggestive of a breakdown in the law of large numbers.",
            "One of the biggest problems in market design is how information is presented to the agents, and how they process it.\nTheoretically, this is the daunting task of converting large amounts of time series information from several series into a concise plan for trading.\nTo handle this researchers are often forced to predene a set of information variables as well as the functional structure used to convert these into trading strategies.\nA second problem is how information is revealed about securities.\nAre there special signals visible only to certain agents?\nAre there costly information variables?\nHow frequent are information releases?\nUnfortunately, there are no easy answers to these questions.",

            "Almost all of the agents that are modeled and discussed in this survey operate inductively.\nThey adopt rules and forecasts which have performed well in the recent past, and they adjust these rules and forecasts to perform better in the future.\nThe early spirit of agent-based models is clearly to push away from more traditional deductive styles of learning and towards more inductive styles of learning.\nHowever, it is often asked if there still may be a role for some form of deductive reasoning.\nIs it going too far to think of agents simply looking for patterns in the past and using behaviors that have worked in the past?\nCan they be allowed to do some form of deductive reasoning?\nCan they learn commonly held theories in nance, such as present value analysis, or the Black-Scholes option pricing formula?\nAn interesting question is whether an agent-based model can be constructed that allows for a little deductive reasoning while keeping the general inductive spirit of simple rules of thumb.",
            "Many beginning researchers view the GA as a kind of black box, and simply follow previous work in setup and structure.24 This approach is probably a mistake.\nIt is important to think more about evolutionary computation in general than about the particular pieces of the GA. The general eld of evolutionary computation includes other methods such as evolutionary programming, and evolutionary strategies, and genetic programming.\nFor the consumer of these techniques distinctions are somewhat unnecessary, and parts of dierent methods should be used when the problem warrants it.25 Setting up an evolutionary learning framework requires several preliminary steps.\nFirst, the mapping from behavioral rules into a genetic structure is important.\nIn some contexts this might involve simply combining real-valued parameters into a vector of parameters, or in some instances it might involve coding real values as strings of zeros and ones.\nIt also may involve taking a complex representation such as a neural network and mapping it into some simpler object.\nOne needs to end up with some type of object that represents the behavior and that can be easily manipulated by evolutionary operators."

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "extreme, agents may operate completely on their own, learning rules over time, and only reacting with others through common price and information variables.\nHowever, in nancial settings it may be useful to try to implement some form of communication across agents, or even to transfer rule-based information across individuals from generation to generation.\nHow this information transfer is handled may be critical in market dynamics; these information correlations cause eventual strategy correlations, which can translate into large price movements and other features suggestive of a breakdown in the law of large numbers.",
            "One of the biggest problems in market design is how information is presented to the agents, and how they process it.\nTheoretically, this is the daunting task of converting large amounts of time series information from several series into a concise plan for trading.\nTo handle this researchers are often forced to predene a set of information variables as well as the functional structure used to convert these into trading strategies.\nA second problem is how information is revealed about securities.\nAre there special signals visible only to certain agents?\nAre there costly information variables?\nHow frequent are information releases?\nUnfortunately, there are no easy answers to these questions."

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",
            "The exchange rate is given by et = p1,t p2,t . (11)",
            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",
            "Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

            "In the mid to later part of the 20th century, finance witnessed a revolution. The advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula put the f ield on a new, solid scientific foundation. This world was built on the assumption that asset markets were powerful computational engines, and were able to aggregate and process the beliefs and demands of traders, leaving in prices the full set of properly processed information currently available. At the core of asset pricing, efficient market theories give a clean and compelling picture of the world which is as appealing to financial economists as it is potentially unappealing to financial practitioners.1 It is interesting to note that these foundations came with a very important computational dimension. The early availability of large machine-readable data sets, and the computational power to analyze them, laid the critical foundation for this new financial rigor.2 In agent-based computational models the computer is once again at the center of a change in thinking about financial markets. This time it is helping to pursue a world view in which agents may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.",

            "Probably the most important question is the design of the economic environment itself. What types of securities will be traded? Will there be some kind of fundamental value, and how does this move? Is there an attempt to model a large subset of the macro economy or just a very specific financial market? As in any economic modeling situation these are not easy questions. In the case of agent-based models they are often more complicated, since the accepted knowledge of how to craft good and interesting worlds of heterogeneous agents is still not something economists are very good at. It is not clear that the knowledge base for building representative agent macro economies will necessarily carry over into the agent-based world. This design question is probably the most important, and the most difficult to give guidance on.",

He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agents is given by,",

            "A common concern about all agent-based computational modeling is validation. The usual criticism leveled at agent-based financial markets is that there are too many degrees of freedom. Researchers are able not just to move freely through large parameter spaces, but can also change entire internal mechanisms at their discretion in the attempt to fit sets of stylized facts. Anyone using agent-based financial markets must acknowledge that there is some truth to these criticisms. However, these comments should not stop all experimentation. Furthermore, there are directions in which the field is moving that will give these markets a more solid foundation.",
            "A final problem, often ignored, is timing. Almost all agent-based models need to make explicit assump tions about the timing of decisions, information, and trade. Of course, any asset pricing model needs to make these choices, but in analytic settings more events can be assumed to take place simultaneously. In the computer this sequence of events often needs to be spelled out. The degree to which results depend on arbitrary timing decisions is definitely important. One example that has been discussed here is the delayed price adjustment approach, where prices are adjusted based on current excess demand in the market. It is important to note that in a world of evolving strategies, this timing may have a large impact since the strategies themselves adapt to the specific timing and trading structures. It will be interesting to see if agent-based financial models start permitting actions to take place more asynchronously, and if this has an\n impact on any of the early results.",

That AHRC should consider ways that employers can assist in creating a workplace where exposure to discussion and engagement via social media platforms does not impact an employees right to a safe work environment.\n3. That AHRC investigate how a criminal code and a civil regime to combat on-line sexual harassment in Australia might be implemented.\n4. That any discussion on criminality and penalties designed to combat on-line sexual harassment must also recognise that it is important to give individuals the legal tools to allow them to:\n Seek injunctive relief and damages from the perpetrators of on-line sexual harassment, and\n Seek injunctive relief and damages from the providers and facilitators of online forums where the provider or facilitator has failed to discharge a duty to monitor and protect users.\n5. That the SDA should impose a positive obligation on employers to take all reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment occurring in the workplace, whether an incident has occurred or not.\n6. That State and Territory WHS authorities be explicitly authorised to investigate and impose sanctions on employers who have breached their duty to provide safe and without risk workplaces, particularly in the context of sexual harassment.\n7. That State and Territory WHS authorities be appropriately resourced to investigate and prosecute risks to health and safety arising from sexual harassment.\n8. That trade unions be granted the authority to prosecute for health and safety breaches reinstated where such rights have been removed.\n9. That the AHRC recommend a process for formally requiring that reporting of sexual harassment claims and statistics be made to the board of the defined entity and to an external organisation.\n10.\nThat businesses should also be required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their reporting requirements to WGEA.\n11.\nThat the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (2017) should be repealed and that the time for making complaints should be amended to 6 years in line with other discrimination jurisdictions.\n12.\nThat the time limit imposed by s46PH(b) of the AHRC Act should be abolished, especially with respect to sexual harassment complaints.\n13.\nThat AHRC explore the insertion of statutory criteria to be taken into account by the Courts when determining an award of damages.\n14.\nThat the SDA should be amended so that in addition to compensation, penalties are also payable by respondents who are found liable for sexual harassment.\n15.\nThat the AHRC Act should be amended to expressly prescribe time frames for the scheduling of mediation conferences.\n16.\nThat the AHRC Act should be amended to make it mandatory for respondents to attend the mediation conference and to file a reply document within a specified period of time.\n17.\nThat the AHRC be properly funded and fully staffed in order to fulfil its statutory objectives.\n18.\nThat AHRC consider the establishment of a victim advocate role within the AHRC to conduct mediations for those who cannot achieve access to justice.\n19.\nThat a complainant be given the right to elect to bypass the AHRC and proceed straight to court."
